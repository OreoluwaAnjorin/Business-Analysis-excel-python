# Excel & Python Data Analysis â€“ Portfolio Project
This project showcases end-to-end data analysis combining Microsoft Excel and Python to extract actionable insights. Each dataset was explored, cleaned, and visualized using professional-grade tools. With over 15 years of experience in data analytics, this work is a reflection of practical, high-impact analytics practices.

## Project Contents
### `EXCEL PORTFOLIO SHOWCASE.xlsx`
Includes:
- **EMPLOYEE DATASET**: Salary and experience breakdown across departments and roles
- **AD BUDGET VS SALES**: ROI and budget efficiency for companies
- **LOANS AND INTEREST**: Interest computation and repayment analysis
- **PRICE DISCOUNT**: Discount modeling and revenue impact

### `excel_analysis.ipynb`
